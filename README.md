# MST
Implement a program that finds a minimal spanning tree in a weighted graph. A graph 
is stored in a text file as a sequence of comma separated triples. Each triple is parenthesised 
and holds three comma separated values that represent two nodes that define an edge and a 
weight of an edge. The program elaborates a minimal spanning tree and stores it in a text file in the same 
format as the input file.

Example:
The input file: (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 2), (2, 4, 1), (3, 4, 3), (3, 5, 5), (4, 5, 2)
The output file: (1, 2, 1), (2, 4, 1), (1, 5, 2), (3, 4, 3)
